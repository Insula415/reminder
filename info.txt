Hi there!
Thanks for installing my script

This only works with gmail!!

To get up and running, first enter your details into the "secrets.py" file.

Next either choose whether you are sending the reminder to yourself or somebody else

If you are reminding yourself use "python3 sender.py"
If you are reminding somebody else use "python3 sender.py" then manually enter their email

If you have any issues or criticism don't hesitate to email me at fredisheretohelp@protonmail.com
