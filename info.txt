Hi there!
Thanks for installing my script

To get up and running, first enter your details into the "secrets.py" file.

Next either choose whether you are sending the reminder to yourself or somebody else

If you are reminding yourself use "python3 sender.py"
If you are reminding somebody else use "python3 sender.py" then manually enter their email

If you have any issues or criticism don't hesitate to email me at fredisheretohelp@protonmail.com

If you want to make the script a command so you only have to type a word in the terminal follow these steps:

1. Type "chmod +x sender.py" (or "sender2.py") in your terminal. (make sure you are in the correct file path)

2. Next, type sudo cp sender.py /usr/bin/email. 
The last word is what you need to type in the terminal, example: sudo cp sender.py /usr/bin/hello - I would type "hello" to run it.
(you will need to move the secrets.py file to /usr/bin too)

3. That's it. Now when you type "email" in any directory it should work!

!!!YOU MAY NEED TO INSTALL COLORAMA!!!
